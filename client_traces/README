This dir contains the kernel modules for generating these traces:
* pre-cache file access trace (file_trace.ko)
* post-cache file access trace (post_cache_trace.ko)

Plus each module has a utility that reads the trace:
* read_file_log.c reads the file trace
* read_post_cache_log.c reads the post cache trace

There exists a third client trace, the block-level trace. See the stackbd/ submodule.
